# Contributing to Quantum Storage System

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Quantum Storage System! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community. Please read and follow our Code of Conduct:
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++17 support (GCC 8+, Clang 7+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.15 or higher
- Git

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantum-storage-system.git
   cd quantum-storage-system
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/quantum-storage-system.git
   ```
4. **Create a development branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Building the Project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd build
ctest --verbose
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- **C++ Standard**: Use C++17 features
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Functions/Methods: `camelCase`
  - Constants: `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
  - Variables: `lowercase_with_underscores`
- **Indentation**: 4 spaces
- **Line Length**: Maximum 100 characters recommended
- **Comments**: Use meaningful comments explaining "why" not "what"

### Example Code Style

```cpp
// Class definition
class QuantumOptimizer {
private:
    double entanglement_factor_;
    std::vector<uint8_t> quantum_states_;
    
    // Private methods use snake_case
    bool CalculateOptimalState();
    
public:
    // Constructor
    QuantumOptimizer();
    
    // Public methods
    bool Initialize();
    void Optimize(const std::vector<uint8_t>& data);
};

// Implementation
bool QuantumOptimizer::Initialize() {
    // Use meaningful variable names
    constexpr double DEFAULT_THRESHOLD = 0.5;
    
    // Comments explain the why
    // Initialize quantum states to superposition
    quantum_states_.resize(4, 0.5);
    
    return true;
}
```

### Git Workflow

1. **Keep commits atomic** - Each commit should represent a single logical change
2. **Write clear commit messages**:
   ```
   [COMPONENT] Brief description
   
   Detailed explanation of changes and why they were made.
   
   Fixes #123
   ```
3. **Rebase before pushing**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Format

```
[FEATURE|BUGFIX|DOCS|TEST|REFACTOR] Component: Brief description

Longer explanation of the change, why it was needed, and any
relevant context. Reference issues and pull requests as needed.

Fixes #123
Related to #456
```

Examples:
- `[FEATURE] Encryption: Implement AES-256 encryption support`
- `[BUGFIX] Cloud Integration: Fix Azure authentication timeout`
- `[DOCS] README: Add installation guide for macOS`
- `[TEST] ML Optimizer: Add unit tests for prediction accuracy`
- `[REFACTOR] Virtual Manager: Simplify space calculation logic`
